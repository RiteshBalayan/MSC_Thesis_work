class GL_functions:#This is Model Used to generate Bins Structure in GL Method
    '''GL Method has two defining functions first is the model which makes periodic bins, and Second is the liklihood function.
    Model is Defined as j(t)= int[1+m(wt+phi)mod2pi/2pi]

     Liklyhood is split into several parts wj, dw, d2w and kai_square (Look paper for theier meaning)

     refer (gregory 1992)

     This code Assumes Data is numpy array with three column (Time, Flux, and Error)
